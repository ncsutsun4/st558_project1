# JSON data description
  
  **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight and flexible data format that is easy for humans to read and for machines to parse. JSON has become a common format used in: 
  
  * Public APIs (e.g., Twitter)
  * NoSQL databases as a document format (e.g., MongoDB)
  * Relational databases as a new column type (e.g., PostgreSQL)
  
  JSON format is text only and independent to any programming language, so it is a good way to store data. 
  
  [Wikipedia introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and [JSON syntax introduction](http://json.org/).
  
# Ways to read JSON data into R

  There three major R packages available for reading JSON data into R (rjson, RJSONIO and jsonlite). Examples to compare behavior and performance of those three packages are [here](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/31702_9c22e3d1a0c44968a4a1f9656f1800ab.html). I prefer jsonlite because it provides more options for manipulating the format and most importantly we can get well formatted data by default.

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```
