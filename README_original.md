  - Describe Json data. 
  - Discuss the possible packages/functions taht are available for reading JSON data into R. (Choose 1 of 3)
  - Write function to contact the NHL records "Franchise" API  (https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/records-api.md) and return data
    * /franchise(Retuns id, firstSeasonID and lastSeasonID and names of every team in history)
